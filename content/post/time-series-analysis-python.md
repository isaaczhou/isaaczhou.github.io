From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists.
I will demonstrate how to conduct time series analysis in Python in following order:

-   Introduction to time series
-   Typical time series models
    1.  Autoregresive
    2.  Moving Average
    3.  Cointegration
-   Along the way, I will show how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python.

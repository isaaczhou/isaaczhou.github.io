## What is a Deep Neural Network {#what-is-a-deep-neural-network}

{{<figure src="/img/neural-networks/deepnn.png">}}

-   A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can be trained using input data, e.g. camera images or sensor readings, and generate output like what's steering angle the car should take or how fast it should go
-   The idea is that the neural network learns from observing the world, without being taught anything specific beforehand
-   A deep neural network is just a term that describes a huge multi-layer neural network with many hidden layers
-   Deep learning is using deep neural networks to sovle problems and it's becoming increasingly important for self-driving cars

My name is [Isaac Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaaczhou/).

I am a data scientist and life-long learner who is working & living in New York City. 

I've spent years in building models and data products to facilitate the consulting projects within my company. I also code a lot as a personal hobby during my spare time. Python and R have always been my favorite ones. Meanwhile, I am pikcing up Javascript, D3 and React to build full-stack data products. 

I have a master degree in finance and several years experience working as a management consultant for leading global companies from different industries such as automotive, energy, industrial, telecommunication, white goods and so one. Over the course of my study and career, I have developed a skill set in analyzing data, building models and communicating results to non technical people. 

This website makes use of a variety of tools:

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): My favorite text editor
* [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/): A fantastic tool for keeping notes and practicing [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
* [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/): I recently migrated from [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) to Hugo and feel really happy about this decision. Hugo is fast, easy and beautiful to build.

My name is [Isaac Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaaczhou/).

I am a data scientist and life-long learner working & living in New York City. 

I've spent years building models and data-driven products to support the consulting projects for my employer and clients. I also code a lot as a personal hobby during my spare time. Python (together with its powerful libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Scipy, Keras etc.) is my favorite language. Meanwhile, I code a lot Javascript (ES2015+), D3 and React to build full-stack web apps. In addition, I also use SQL (PostgreSQL) and R for data analysis. Although not a big fan, but I sometimes code in VBA to facilitate the Excel needs from management consulting projects. Finally I wrote my master thesis in Matlab but I definitely don't want to use it for my daily work.

I have a master degree in finance and several years experience working as a management consultant for leading global companies from different industries such as automotive, energy, industrial, telecommunication, white goods and so one. 

At the moment, I created and lead a new exciting division at my current employer to provide data app products (rather than consulting projects) for our clients.

Over the course of my study and career, I have developed a skill set in analyzing data, building models and communicating results to non technical people. 

This website makes use of a variety of tools:

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): My favorite text editor
* [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/): A fantastic tool for keeping notes (actually to some extent life) organized. Jupyter notebook is a great tool but I gave it up after discovering the org babel functionalities practicing [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
* [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/): I recently migrated from [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) to Hugo and feel really happy about this decision. Hugo is fast, easy and beautiful to build.

Keep believing and building!

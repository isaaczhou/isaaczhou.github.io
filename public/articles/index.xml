      <title>Org-Mode Capabilities</title>

      <description>One of the reasons my marriage with Jupyter didn&amp;rsquo;t hold was the beautiful and sexy org-mode. I was totally blown away the first time I saw it. Just like emacs is more than a text editor; org-mode is much more than a note-taking, spreadsheet, task tracker, planner, literate programming code editor (Oh Yeah!!!)&amp;hellip; I guess the proper definition for org-mode is really an Emacs subsystem.
The Almighty Org-Mode The org-mode was first introduced to the world in 2008 at this Google Talk.</description>

      <description>A little bit about my background Actually I learnt about emacs really long time ago. It was around 2003~2004, when I was still a college student majoring in Computer Science back in China. I majored in a top notch major in a top tier engineering school in China. However, I was not in love of it. The environment was really choking back then and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see my future there.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

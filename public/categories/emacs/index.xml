      <description>One of the reasons my marriage with Jupyter didn&amp;rsquo;t hold was the beautiful and sexy org-mode. I was totally blown away the first time I saw it. Just like emacs is more than a text editor; org-mode is much more than a note-taking, spreadsheet, task tracker, planner, literate programming code editor (Oh Yeah!!!)&amp;hellip; I guess the proper definition for org-mode is really an Emacs subsystem.
The Almighty Org-Mode The org-mode was first introduced to the world in 2008 at this Google Talk.</description>

      <description>A little bit about my background Actually I learnt about emacs really long time ago. It was around 2003~2004, when I was still a college student majoring in Computer Science back in China. I majored in a top notch major in a top tier engineering school in China. However, I was not in love of it. The environment was really choking back then and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see my future there.</description>

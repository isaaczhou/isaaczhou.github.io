      <description> What is a Deep Neural Network    A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can be trained using input data, e.g. camera images or sensor readings, and generate output like what&amp;rsquo;s steering angle the car should take or how fast it should go The idea is that the neural network learns from observing the world, without being taught anything specific beforehand A deep neural network is just a term that describes a huge multi-layer neural network with many hidden layers Deep learning is using deep neural networks to sovle problems and it&amp;rsquo;s becoming increasingly important for self-driving cars  </description>

      <description>From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. I will demonstrate how to conduct time series analysis in Python in following order:
 Introduction to time series Typical time series models  Autoregresive Moving Average Cointegration  Along the way, I will show how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python.</description>

      <description>History This is a documentary on the seminal DARPA Grand Challenge, the beginning of the self-driving car history.   (Udacity, 2018)
Where are we now: 2018 This is the year of 2018. Even after years&amp;rsquo; of hard working and innovation, the day that youâ€™ll be able to buy a self-driving car, or even ride in one, is a lot further out than you probably think.   (Verge, 2018)</description>

      <title>Org-Mode Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://isaaczhou.github.io/post/all-about-org-mode/</link>

      <description>One of the reasons my marriage with Jupyter didn&amp;rsquo;t hold was the beautiful and sexy org-mode. I was totally blown away the first time I saw it. Just like emacs is more than a text editor; org-mode is much more than a note-taking, spreadsheet, task tracker, planner, literate programming code editor (Oh Yeah!!!)&amp;hellip; I guess the proper definition for org-mode is really an Emacs subsystem.
The Almighty Org-Mode The org-mode was first introduced to the world in 2008 at this Google Talk.</description>

      <description>A little bit about my background Actually I learnt about emacs really long time ago. It was around 2003~2004, when I was still a college student majoring in Computer Science back in China. I majored in a top notch major in a top tier engineering school in China. However, I was not in love of it. The environment was really choking back then and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see my future there.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

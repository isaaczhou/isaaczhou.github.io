      <description> What is a Deep Neural Network    A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can be trained using input data, e.g. camera images or sensor readings, and generate output like what&amp;rsquo;s steering angle the car should take or how fast it should go The idea is that the neural network learns from observing the world, without being taught anything specific beforehand A deep neural network is just a term that describes a huge multi-layer neural network with many hidden layers Deep learning is using deep neural networks to sovle problems and it&amp;rsquo;s becoming increasingly important for self-driving cars  </description>
